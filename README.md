# CPSC 210 Term Project

## Expense Tracker


This application will help people **keep track of their expenses**. A user will be able to *record their transactions*
and *categorize* them. They will also be able to view transactions by their category and view their account balance. 
This will let them have a visual representation of how they spend their money.
This expense tracker can be used by anyone who wants to keep track of their finances and will help them see how their money is being spent.
This particular project was of interest to me because of its practicality and usefulness and is something I see myself using as well.
