# CPSC 210 Term Project

## Expense Tracker


- this application will help a person **keep track of their expenses** by *recording their transactions*, allowing them to *categorize* the ways in which they want to spend their money and set a monthly *budget* for each category
- it can be used by people who need to track their finances, budget their income, or have a visual representation of how they are spending their money
- this project is of interest to me because of its practicality


## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a transaction to my list of transactions
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a transaction from my list of transactions
- As a user, I want to be able to view my transaction history
