# CPSC 210 Term Project

## Expense Tracker


- this application will help a person **keep track of their expenses** by *recording their transactions* and allowing them to *categorize* the ways in which they spend their money
- it can be used by people who need to track their finances and have a representation of how they are spending their money
- this project is of interest to me because of its practicality and usefulness
